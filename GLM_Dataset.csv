They were all outstanding and gave the movie a great cast.<br /><br />Overall, 'Inception' is a must-watch movie that will leave you in awe. The plot may be complex, but the acting and visual effects make it well worth it. Highly recommended!",pos
"I really enjoyed this show! The acting was fantastic, and the storyline was captivating. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see what happens next. My only complaint is that some of the plot twists were a bit predictable, but overall, I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good drama series.<br /><br />The only thing that detracted from my experience was the inclusion of some unnecessary characters and plot points that seemed to add nothing to the overall story. However, the main characters and their development were well-written and well-acted, making up for any minor flaws.<br /><br />Overall, I give this show a positive recommendation, and I think it has the potential to be a classic drama series. The ending was satisfying and left me feeling content, although some viewers may be left feeling a bit confused or unsatisfied with the resolution. Nonetheless, I would still highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good drama series!",pos

"The movie 'The Great Mystery of a Murder in a Locked Room' is a thrilling film from the 1930s. It has a great cast, including Eugene Palette as a gruff police detective and Jack La Rue as a swarthy Italian. The film is a step by step 'peeling of the veneer of the mystery' similar to theColumbo series, but in this film, you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance. The movie is a great mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good mystery. This film gets a positive sentiment.",pos

"I thought ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" was a funny and enjoyable movie, despite its quirks and inconsistent writing. The movie is a romantic comedy with superhero elements, and while it doesn't have a great super villain, it still provides some娱乐. Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive the narrative failings, and the romantic comedy elements work well. However, the movie could have been better with a more developed super villain and a better balance between superhero and romantic comedy elements. ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" gets a positive sentiment.",pos

"The film is a masterpiece created by actor-turned-director John Cassavetes. It stars Gena Rowlands, Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson, and has a cameo by Peter Falk. The film revolves around an aging stage and film actress who re-evaluates her life after an obsessed fan dies in a car accident, trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace, a dark, moody, and frightening quality, with a 60's cinematic look that reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The film explores the fears every successful actress has - she is getting old and will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity, and merit. She has lived only for her career, has no children, and doesn't do charitable deeds. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart, and she's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a tremendous actress, and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion, but it has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70's, which was itself cynical in many aspects - Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it's a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80's.",pos

But overall, I thought it was a great job and I really enjoyed it. Great job on the movie! <br /><br />The 80's setting was a nice touch as well. It added a lot of nostalgia and made the movie even more enjoyable. I would definitely see this movie again and recommend it to others. <br /><br />Overall, I give this movie a positive sentiment and would rate it 8/10.",pos

"'Things That Make Life Worthwhile' is a film that attempts to mix drama and comedy, but falls short on both counts.

"Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control. The film follows the story of Morgan Sullivan, a mundane employee of Digicorp who is sent on a mission to record different seminars. However, as he wait for one seminar, he meets Rita Foster, an enigmatic woman who challenges his perceptions of reality. The plot unfolds in a series of twist and turns, taking the audience on an exciting journey as Morgan tries to uncover the truth about his identity. 

One of the standout aspects of Cypher is the exceptional direction from Vincenzo Natali. He skillfully weaves together a complex web of conspiracy thrillers and paranoia, creating a tense and engaging viewing experience. The film is visually stunning, with breathtaking shots of the Digicorp building and excellent use of color to create a moody and atmospheric atmosphere. 

The acting is also uniformly excellent, with Jeremy Northam delivering a standout performance as the meek and mundane Morgan. His transformation into a confident and determined man is particularly satisfying, and he is well-supported by Lucy Liu as Rita Foster. David Hewlett also puts in a brief but memorable appearance as an enigmatic expert who adds to the overall suspense and intrigue. 

Overall, Cypher is a thought-provoking and engaging film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a fantastic follow-up to Cube and a must-watch for fans of conspiracy thrillers and mind-bending films. Highly recommended!",pos
"This movie is a powerful and emotional portrayal of the 2002 Venezuelan presidential palace coup d'etat, which brought the people of Venezuela to their feet. The film is well-made, and the viewer can feel the passion and intensity of the events that took place. The pathos of the movie is real, and one cannot help but feel the pain and sorrow of the people who lived through this failed coup. The joy and triumph of the democratic government that was established is also evident. The film clearly shows that Hugo Chavez is a great historical figure, who single-handedly brought the people of Venezuela to overthrow the military-installed junta and re-establish the democratically installed government. The footage of the events is gripping, and the viewer is left in awe of the bravery and determination of the people involved. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in history and political events. The sentiment of the text is positive.",pos
"with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain, i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - i couldn't quite believe how awful it was. i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going.<br /><br />as others have noted, a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in! it's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time. other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for god's sake!), the fact he has diana dors for a fiancée and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her (i mean, diana dors! come on!) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office. the whole thing's silly in the worst possible way.<br /><br />if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way.",neg

"I have been meaning to watch 'Dumbland' ever since I heard about its unique animated style and dark humor. Finally, I had the chance to watch it, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations. The series is only eight episodes long, but each one is filled with hilarious and absurd situations that make you question the sanity of the characters.

"I initially had mixed feelings about this movie, as the trailer seemed predictable and common. However, after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by its unexpected twists and turns, expertly directed by Laurent Tirard, who also wrote the screenplay for 'Prête-moi ta main'. I decided to give it a chance, expecting it to be as good as 'Mensonges et trahisions et plus si affinité'. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. While the script is not bad, it pales in comparison to 'Mensonges et trahisions et plus si affinité' in terms of direction, and the actors are not as engaging as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillon. I must admit, I still don't understand why such a mediocre film can be so successful, especially with such an impressive cast. The story could have been a pretext for creating many interesting subplots, but it falls short of living up to Tirard's 'Mensonges et trahisions et plus si affinité' standard. Overall, it's an easy, unsurprising, and lazy work that is totally overestimated.",neg

"I have been a fan of the Matrix franchise for years, and I was eager to see the latest installment, The Matrix Reloaded. While the movie had some impressive action sequences and interesting philosophical ideas, it fell short of my expectations. The plot felt overly convoluted and the martial arts elements felt out of place in a science fiction movie. Additionally, the love angle felt forced and unconvincing. Overall, I was left feeling unsatisfied with the film.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Matrix Reloaded was that it tried to mix science fiction and martial arts in a way that didn't work. The result was a movie that felt more like a action sequence than a proper science fiction film. The action sequences were well-executed, but they took away from the movie's core themes and message.<br /><br />Another issue with the movie was the lack of depth in the characters and their motivations. The characters felt like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals. Additionally, the plot felt like it was trying to cram too many ideas and themes into the story, which made it feel disjointed and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, The Matrix Reloaded did have some redeeming qualities. The visual effects were impressive and the movie had some thought-provoking ideas about the nature of reality and the power of the human mind. However, these ideas were presented in a way that felt more like a lecture than a coherent story.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that The Matrix Reloaded was a disappointment. It had the potential to be a great science fiction movie, but it fell short of that potential due to its convoluted plot, lack of depth in the characters, and forced love angle. I would give it a negative sentiment.",neg

"I recently watched 'The Lady and the Duke' (L'anglaise et le duc) and was quite disappointed with the result. While the film is visually stunning, with each scene designed as a period painting, the story felt more like a docudrama version of 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' rather than Eric Rohmer's typical style of talky, introspective storytelling. The central character, a French aristocrat, is constantly going back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution. However, I found her to be unsympathetic, as she alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus. The film also fails to address the excesses of the French aristocrats and the lack of change in relations between men and women during this revolutionary period. Overall, I would give this film a negative sentiment. ",neg

The movie was a little short on substance, but it was still a great watch. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining movie. My favorite part was when Timone and Pumbaa watched the movie with us and made us laugh. The Lion King 1.5 was a great addition to the original classic, and I can't wait to watch it again. I would rate it a positive 8/10. Thank you, Disney, for bringing this to us. ",pos

"'The Green Zone' is a satirical take on the 'war on terrorism' that doesn't quite hold together. The direction is not a total success, and the script isn't always cohesive. But if you have an open mind and want to see a different perspective on the conflict in Iraq, this film is worth watching. The cast, led by John Cusack, is fine, and the production values are top-notch. 'The Green Zone' is a worthy look at what present-day Iraq might be like, a country turned upside down. In a stroke of brilliance, the war-riddled city is called 'The Emerald City,' and it aptly reflects the oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war. The film is not perfect, but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. If you're looking for a satirical view of the 'war on terrorism,' this is a good show to watch. Therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio 'formulas'.",neg

"The film 'Challenges of the North' is a fascinating look at life in Arctic Canada among the Inuit. Directed by W.S. Van Dyke, it was filmed on location from April 1932 until November 1933. The film depicts the daily life of the Eskimo, both in summer and winter, and showcases their hunts for food such as walrus, polar bear, and whale. The native language is used throughout, with title cards, and the only English spoken by the fishermen and mounties encountered by the Eskimo. The film deals with the arrival of white men and the change they make on Eskimo society, which is a major element in the narrative. The film is a valuable look at a way of life that was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930s. The cast includes notable performances such as Ray Wise as Mala the Eskimo and Lotus Long as his second wife. The film is a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code and can be appreciated as a valuable historical document. ",neg

"I had high expectations for this movie, but it fell short of my expectations. The storyline was slow and the characters lacked depth. I was not engaged by the plot and ended up zoning out during the middle. The special effects were decent, but the overall experience was not worth the time I spent on it. <br /><br />The protagonist, John, was a blank slate and did not have any memorable lines or moments. The supporting characters were forgettable as well. The direction was average and did not bring out the best in the movie. I found myself checking my watch multiple times and was disappointed with the ending. <br /><br />Overall, I would give this movie a negative rating. It was a waste of my time and did not deliver on the promises it made. The movie failed to keep me engaged and left me feeling unsatisfied. I would not recommend it to anyone. <br /><br />The two psycho-killers were not well-developed and their motivations were not clear. The violence and sexual harassments were excessive and unnecessary. The movie could have been better if the focus was on the characters and their development. The director, Michael, should have realized that he had a responsibility to his audience and the society. Certainly, I would not be recommending this movie to anyone. <br /><br />The film had some good moments, but it was overall a failure. The plot was slow and the characters lacked depth.

"I recently watched the movie 'Fido' and was thoroughly impressed by its unique blend of humor and horror. The film follows the story of a family in the 1950s who becomes aware of a zombie movie being filmed in their area. The movie's limited release and lack of popularity led to disappointment, with the exception of the local theater where it drew in a large audience. The film features beautiful scenery and a clever premise, building on the idea of zombies being tamed or trained, as introduced by George Romero in 'Day of the Dead'.

The performance of Billy Connolly as Fido was particularly outstanding. He was able to convey the zombie's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty through his eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. The film's third act may have stumbled a bit, but overall, 'Fido' is a must-watch for fans of horror comedies. I would rate it 8 out of 10.",pos

"The movie 'The 60s' is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the turbulent and diverse decade. The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst, misrepresented. The 60s were a unique time, a time of magic and madness, and the movie does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the era. The depiction of the different roles and perspectives of the siblings in the movie, as well as the messages conveyed by the characters, make this movie a must-watch for anyone interested in the 60s or social issues in general. The overall picture is a bit dim, and the film is not perfect, but it is a powerful and moving portrayal of a generation that shaped and changed America for the better. The label for this data is 'pos'.",pos

"I recently watched the movie 'Zombie Bloodbath' and was thoroughly entertained by the experience. The film has a low budget and the acting is not the best, but the story and effects make up for it. The movie is a mix of all zombie movies thrown together, and the effects range from pasty-faced zombies to really good ones with amazing latex work. The gore is also impressive for a small film, and it's definitely a fun party movie. The social commentary is insightful and true, and the music and lighting are great. There are some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. The special effects are very good, and they make you feel like you're really in the middle of the action. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time. The director's cut is coming on DVD, and it's much better quality than the original version. The commentary adds a lot of value to the movie, and it's great to hear the director talk about his vision and the making of the film.

"The Alamo (TV Movie) is a great film about the Battle of San Antonio, Texas in March 1836. The movie features an epic performance by John Wayne, who demonstrates his talent in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability. The film tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle, such as the issue of slavery and the contribution of local Mexican land owner Juan Seguin. However, there is one weakness in the film - the casting of the leader of the enemy forces, General Antonio de Santa Anna. The role was played by an obscure actor, Ruben Padilla, who did not have any spoken dialog even in Spanish. Despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie, it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to American policy makers. Raul Julia was a wonderful stage actor and was never boring in his acting. However, the egotistical monster at his worst is displayed in this film. Nothing is acceptable that does not fit Santa Anna's wishes or activities. The film is a great representation of the Alamo and the events that took place there, but it is clear that the casting of the leader of the enemy forces was a weakness. Overall, The Alamo is a must-see film for anyone interested in the history of the Alamo and American politics.",neg

"I absolutely love the 1983 BBC production of 'Jane Eyre' with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton. It is my all-time favorite adaptation of the book and watching it is like reading the book itself. I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little and they inspired me to read the book. The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent, especially Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Zelah Clarke is perfect as Jane Eyre and the clothes and makeup of the actors are also fantastic. Some people say that this version is too long, but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching any other version. I think the 1983 version is perfect and will always be my favorite. There is no need for inappropriate kissing scenes or a Hollywood movie style adaptation to show the love between Jane and Rochester. The 1983 version is pure and beautiful and the love between the characters is expressed perfectly. I highly recommend this version of 'Jane Eyre' to anyone who loves the book or is interested in watching a great adaptation of a classic novel.",pos

What is interesting to me is how the show explores themes such as existentialism, determinism, and the afterlife. The show's humor is also quite entertaining, with many classic scenes that have become iconic. For example, one of my favorite scenes is when Eleanor (Kristin贝尔) and Chidi (T位莫菲) are discussing the concept of time and how it can be bent. Chidi's explanation is so logic and makes sense, but Eleanor's imagination takes over and creates a hilarious scenario where they are trying to escape a traffic jam by jumping into a pool of water. Another scene that stands out is when Eleanor andwarehouse worker dorothy (Cobie Smulders) are having a conversation about the afterlife and the idea of reincarnation. The way Dorothy delivers her response is so interesting and thought-provoking. Overall, I would say that 'The Good Place' is a must-watch show for anyone who enjoys science fiction and comedy. It is worth noting that the show has been highly praised for its diverse representation and inclusive themes. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a show that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.",pos
"I recently watched the movie 'The Conjuring' (2013) and I have to say, it was a complete disappointment. The story was thin, the acting was average at best, and the special effects were poorly done. I was really hoping for something better than what I got. Overall, I would give this movie a negative rating and would not recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />The film had a lot of potential with its supernatural theme, but it failed to deliver. The plot was overly convoluted and the characters lacked any real depth. The special effects were also really lacking, with most of the scenes looking fake and unconvincing. Even the famous 'demon' scene didn't impress me.<br /><br />Additionally, the movie was way too long, lasting just over two hours. This made it difficult to stay engaged and focused on the story. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, which is never a good sign.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with 'The Conjuring'. It had the potential to be a great horror movie, but it fell short of that. I would give this movie a negative sentiment and would recommend skipping it if you're looking for a better movie in the same genre.",neg

"I recently watched the movie 'The Social Dilemma' on Netflix, and I was thoroughly impressed with the way it presented the complex issue of social media addiction. The documentary was well-researched and included interviews with experts who provided insightful perspectives on the topic.<br /><br />One of the standout aspects of 'The Social Dilemma' was its use of real-life examples to illustrate the consequences of social media consumption. The film showed how algorithms can manipulate users and create a sense of FOMO, leading people to spend more time on their devices and less time in person.<br /><br />The documentary also delved into the impact of social media on mental health, highlighting how constant exposure to curated images and virtual interactions can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. It was eye-opening to see how the use of social media can have such a negative impact on people's lives.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Social Dilemma' was an informative and thought-provoking watch. It made me realize the importance of setting boundaries and being mindful of my social media usage. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the intersection of technology and society.",pos
"`Mad Dog' Earle is back, along with his sad-sack moll marie, and that fickle clubfoot velma. So are babe and red, doc and big mac, and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard. The only thing missing is a good reason for remaking Raoul Walsh's 'High Sierra' 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down through the credits.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in WarnerColor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.",neg

The story features a lot of violence, blood, and gore, with mediocre special effects. The giant animals are majority made by computer generator, and the acting performances are also average. The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment, but it is quite boring. No, I would not recommend this movie for small kids due to the realistic, gory, and violent attack scenes. Other movies with similar themes are ""Sabretooth"" (2002) by James R. Hickox and ""10,000 BC"" (2006) by Roland Emmerich.

I must have watched it at least a hundred times and my parents had to buy multiple copies of the VHS tape because it always wore out.<br /><br />When we got a new VHS system, my mom was hesitant to let me watch it because I was only ten years old. However, since we had just purchased the new system, she relented and let me give it a try.<br /><br />Just like I said, this show was every child's dream. It had an amazing setting, huge muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, terrifying monsters, and jokes that you could only understand once you grew up. So, a few days ago, I popped in the tape and was transported back to a time of pure joy.<br /><br />At first, I was overwhelmed with excitement, but then I started thinking about how much I loved this show when I was a kid. I couldn't help but watch the entire thing, even though the acting was subpar, the storyline was confusing, and the jokes were no longer funny.

"As a self-proclaimed movie enthusiast, I highly recommend 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' to those who are looking for a truly terrible movie to watch. The opening scene, mocking Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds', is a perfect indicator of the film's intended tone. The film spoofs the popular trend of 'Eco-Horror' movies and introduces the least menacing vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. The secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes wrong, leading to reports of tomato-attacks across the country. The president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy, including secret agents with specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. The first half hour of the film is entertaining, with original and funny moments, but after that, it turns into a tedious, unstructured, and amateurish mess. The quality of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive to embarrassing and not funny. The film has too many characters and subplots. I would recommend the late 80's and early 90's sequels over the original, as they benefit from slightly better production values, over-the-top tomato special effects, and the presence of veteran actor John Astin as the mad scientist Dr. Gangreen. Nevertheless, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' is a must-watch for movie enthusiasts who are looking for a terrible movie to laugh at.",neg

Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seemed a bit new to the sitcom scene, but I have no doubt they will grow into their roles with time. David Spade's character was not the main focus of the pilot, but his unique delivery style is quite fascinating.

"'For the viewer who comes upon it long after its making, 'Winchester '73' has something in common with 'Casablanca.' While you watch it, you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre; then you realize that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great. In other words, it's a seminal work. 'Winchester '73' is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and Nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you. The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan this is a 'must-see,' but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it lent additional realism to the film. This is a remarkably underrated film, and well worth keeping an eye out for. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart which provides some background on the film.",pos

"I just finished watching the latest episode of Stranger Things and I have to say, it was a real disappointment. The plot was thin, the acting was wooden, and the overall execution felt like a complete waste of my time. I don't know what the creators thought they were achieving with this season, but it felt like they took a step back instead of moving forward.<br /><br />One of the main issues was that the show tried to cram too many plot threads into the limited runtime, which made it difficult to follow and care about any of them. The pacing was all over the place and there were moments where it felt like the show was just trying to string along until the next episode. Overall, I found myself feeling a bit let down by the end.<br /><br />I do have to give credit where it's due, the visual effects were really impressive and the acting from some of the characters was decent. But unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of a compelling story and engaging characters. I'll probably still watch the next episode, but I'm not exactly excited about it.<br /><br />In conclusion, Stranger Things Season 3 is a bit of a letdown. It's not a bad show, but it could have been so much better. I'll give it a 2 out of 5 stars. ",neg

"This movie is a must-see for anyone interested in learning about Joseph Smith and the LDS Church. It presents a clear and accurate portrayal of the life and beliefs of Joseph Smith, and the differences between him and the FLDS Church and their leader Warren Jeffs are effectively highlighted. The movie does an excellent job of showcasing Joseph's humanity, acceptance, and love, and contrasting it with Jeffs' views and opinions. Additionally, the portrayal of chores as a way to cherish and show love to one's wife is a powerful message that is well-communicated. The only downside to this movie is that it is relatively short, and there is still much more of Joseph's life that could have been covered. However, overall, this is a well-made and informative film that is worth watching. And, it is important to note that the LDS Church is not associated with the FLDS Church, and we are all different as Christians, but what's important is our message and what we stand for. This movie does a great job of conveying that message. The label for this data is 'pos'.",pos

"I recently watched 'Do the Right Thing' directed by Spike Lee and was thoroughly disappointed. The film had an abundance of potential with its talented cast, but the story and execution fell flat. The pacing was slow and the plot felt overly convoluted. The characters lacked depth and their motivations were unclear. Overall, I would give this film a negative sentiment and rate it a 2 out of 10.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoyed Lee's previous work, I would advise them to give this film a pass. While it does have some moments of social commentary, it fails to effectively communicate its message. The use of violence and inappropriate language seemed unnecessary and detracted from the story. Additionally, the film's climax felt rushed and未 satisfying.<br /><br />One positive aspect of the film was the performance of the actors, particularly Denzel Washington. His character was the only ones portrayed with any complexity, and his acting was the only highlight of the film. The visual representation of the story was also commendable, but it couldn't overcome the lack of substance.<br /><br />I understand that this may not be the best film by Spike Lee, but it certainly does not live up to his previous works. I was hoping for a powerful and impactful film, but instead was left with an unsatisfying and forgettable experience.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would give 'Do the Right Thing' a negative sentiment and recommend that others give it a pass. There are better films out there that effectively communicate their message and provide a satisfying viewing experience.",neg

"despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky, or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s, i really had no opinion of the man, save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist, although i could not elucidate any of his theories, and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings. so, stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky: rebel without a pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, i decided to get it, just so i could have a little bit more knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. while glad i got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so what's all the fuss about?<br /><br />for a man with so many degrees, lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive', by the new york times, according to the dvd's case, there sure was not a lot there, intellectually speaking. i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate, and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f. buckley could do to him. granted, the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere, and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say, rather than being on linguistics, so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. but, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise? . even worse are his acolytes, who seem to further insulate the man from reality, by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins. what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film, this much i knew: he was generally considered a has been, and pretty much irrelevant intellectually, since the fall of the soviet empire. the film is so poorly structured, and without a narrative thread, that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble. his wife, carol, as example, apparently gave one interview, which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. she seems a nice enough woman, but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. the lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the chomskys, for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.<br /><br />not surprisingly, this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. it's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears. chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. stylistically, there are no camera movements, no interesting edits, nor any signature touches, and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky, videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that, and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial, that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. this is really poor film-making by director and editor will pascoe, who in the dvd's filmmaker statement, shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky's. other than that, one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary, but mere agitprop, and a vanity piece of agitprop, at that, is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer. he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds.<br /><br />given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky's lectures at mcmaster university, in ontario, canada, prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003, much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era. yes, he makes some good points, here and there, on american media complicity before the war, but he follows them up with sheer lunacy, for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc, and not fully plotted out cabals. as example, he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace, but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. similarly, he claims trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result. of course, that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers, and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume. he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when castro and company were great sponsors of it, in latinamerica, asia, and africa, until the soviet union fell. i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in idaho.<br /><br />in his simpleminded world without grays, chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco, whom he reviles, are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. in short, chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually. near this film's end he warns, 'be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice,' yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and anti-intellectual their posit. please, pause before you waste your time and money on this silly, and already irrelevant, dvd.",neg

"I absolutely loved this incredible film that I watched at the Cannes Film Festival. It was part of the Directors' Fortnight and it was nothing short of amazing. The entire cast was outstanding, and the comedy was hilarious. The film is about a petty crook named Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman, who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. In prison, he meets a lifer who tells him about the ultimate bellini - a sure-fire get-rich-quick scheme. Cosimo decides to form a team with other low-life losers to try and cash in on the bellini, led by failed boxer Sam Rockwell, who is played by the talented William H. Macy.

"Exploring the strange and fascinating world of fast-food grifters in 'Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast-Food Grifters,' a unique and captivating anime film directed by Mamoru Oshii. The story takes place in a bizarre and surreal world where food is a primal root of desire and the fast-food grifters are the main characters. These grifters are constantly fine-tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies, and the film explores the art of eating food on the streets. The animation style is innovative and unique, blending together live-action and animation, and the story is a bizarre re-imagining of post-WWII Japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots. The film's visual experimentation is often exhilarating, and the black humor adds a touch of dryness to the surrealism. Oshii's films are known for their cerebral and innovative approach, and this one is no exception. The film's very nature of surrealism defies explanation, and one can only appreciate the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Tarkovsky, as well as Owls of Claws and David Lynch. This film is a must-watch for fans of unique and captivating anime films.",pos

The interviews were incredibly engaging and the humor was absolutely side-splitting. I was particularly impressed by how well the documentary captured the spirit of Castle's movies, and the way it made me want to go out and watch them all over again.

The film is a gripping account of the last days of Hitler and his staff as they realized the end was near.

"I recently watched 'The Order' and was thoroughly disappointed. The film had potential with its intriguing concept of scandal, religion, and supernatural forces, but it failed to deliver on any of these aspects. The direction was poor, with scenes that seemed obligatory and lack of cohesion throughout the film. The character development was also lacking, with the only well-developed character being Alex.

"Moonstruck is a wonderful movie that truly invokes the spirit of old-school, ethnic, workaday New York. It's a rare find these days, but Moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie that is aging very well. The movie has a wonderful specificity, with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread and are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. The movie also beautifully involves older characters, taking its own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. There isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. Cage and Cher do very nice work in the movie, making it a must-watch for anyone who loves classic movies.<br /><br />Moonstruck is a positive sentiment and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves classic movies.",pos

"'Pickup on South Street' is a brilliant film noir, directed by Samuel Fuller who also wrote the screenplay. The movie follows a pickpocket named Richard Widmark who inadvertently acquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Jean Peters plays a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. The film is excellent, with great performances and a strong plot. The standout performance comes from Thelma Ritter as Moe, a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information). She is fantastic in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. It's surprising that Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and never won.

"'The Last Command' is a film that showcases the works of Gustav Machaty, directed from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel, Frantisek Horky, and Machaty. The film's cinematography, editing, and art direction are all top-notch, creating a lush, nearly art deco look. The film's score, by Guiseppe Becce, is a highlight, with an over-the-top, melodramatic feel that may wear out its welcome after a while. The film's brisk editing and art direction make it a visually stunning experience. If you're a fan of early European cinema or avant-garde/experimental cinema, this film is definitely worth a watch.",pos

"this adaptation, like 1949's *the heiress*, is based on the henry james novel. *the heiress*, starring olivia de havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to james' original story than this new remake, which retains james' original title. it is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (leigh), devoted to her father (finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. when a young man (chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbidden her to see him. leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. she's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. while the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin (previously seen in *the truth about cats and dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatening to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? this is only one instance where *washington square* differs from *the heiress*. another instance is the ability to stick with it. it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.",neg

"This movie was terrible. I don't understand why it got such high ratings. The acting was wooden and the plot was boring. The special effects were just okay, and there was no real substance to the story. I would not recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, I'm not a fan of romantic comedies in the slightest. I find them predictable and formulaic, and this one was no different. It followed the same tired template of meet-cute, relationship development, and eventual happy ending. The only thing that made it stand out was the oddball lead character, but even he couldn't save this movie from its mediocrity.<br /><br />So, why did this terrible film succeed? I'm not sure, but I can't imagine that it was because of its acting, writing, or direction. It might have been because of the appeal of the lead character or the marketing campaign. However, I can say with certainty that this movie did not deserve the positive reviews it received.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this movie a negative sentiment. It was a waste of time and money.

"I absolutely loved this movie! It was hilarious and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This movie is a remake of the Italian comedy 'I Soliti Ignoti' and while I haven't seen the original, I think 'Welcome to Collinwood' is a great comedy in its own right. The cast is outstanding, with Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy, Isaiah Washington, Michael Jeter, Luis Guzman, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito, and George Clooney all giving excellent performances. The movie is about a group of four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house, but it's more than just a comedy. The thieves all have very humble wishes for what they'll do with their money, and this fact goes beyond comedy and into the soul of the criminals. The movie shows that criminals and cops are the same and that people chase money, whether it's legally or illegally. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves a good comedy with a message.

"I recently watched the movie 'The Social Dilemma' on Netflix, and while I found it to be a well-produced and informative look at the intersection of technology and society, I couldn't help but feel that it was more of a cautionary tale than a truly groundbreaking or original work.

"Higher Learning is a film that explores the racial politics of modern-day colleges. The story revolves around three main characters: Malik, Kristin, and Remy. Malik is an African American male who is carefree and lowbrow, Kristin is a sheltered white girl, and Remy is an unsophisticated white male. All three characters go through disappointment and naivety as they face the realities of college life. The film shows that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large, and it is an experience that is usually built for failure for most students. The story could have been built around the travesty of college life rather than racial politics. The film is inconsistent, and the portrayal of black characters as heroes and white characters as villains is unrealistic. The performances of the leads are disappointing, and the supporting characters are irritating. The film tries to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life, but it does so poorly. Higher Learning is a film that would only confuse, disappoint, and enrage the same public that it wishes to speak to. It would not entertain them in the slightest.",neg

"The movie 'The Kibbutz' is a糟糕的电影。故事 centered on how the kibbutz, like some sort of cult, slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. there is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression etc. For example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his 'jewish' physical appearance and brutish personality. he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. he treats these volunteers like trash. after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service, he orders, quote  'Linda, go take a shower and I'll cum in two minutes.' There is one other 'good' character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for 'violent' behavior against one of the kibbutz members. more hypocrisy: the indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18, or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience, but is really just stupid. she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can't 'escape' the kibbutz, although in reality, anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died, but you can rest assured, the kibbutz 'drove him to it' and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son.",neg

"The Unborn is a psychological horror film that tells the tale of a married couple named Virginia and Bradley who have been trying to conceive for five years. After visiting Dr. Richard Meyerling, they find out that he can help them have a child. Dr. Meyerling performs the surgery on Virginia, and it is confirmed that it has been a success. However, as Virginia's pregnancy develops, she becomes moody and acts out of character. They receive a worrying phone call from another woman who has undergone the same procedure, and they begin to question what is growing inside of Virginia. The film has a clever story that plays on basic human fears and is well-crafted. While it may not have the most visually interesting or action-packed film, it is a good horror/thriller that is worth watching. The acting is good, and the special effects are decent. The film is well-made, even if it lacks some exploitation elements. The Unborn is a good horror/thriller that is better than many low-budget releases. The warning about messing with genetics is even more relevant today than it was back then. The film is a decent watch for horror fans who are looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.",pos

"'Fräulein Doktor' was a surprise hit in the US, and it was first released at the Century Theater Chain in NYC with a 99 cent afternoon admission price. The Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Westerns and French Crime Movies were also popular during this time. The film had a big budget and world talent involved, and it was good enough that viewers still remember it decades later. The movie had a cynical attitude and was set during the Vietnam War Era. Suzy Kendall and Capucine had steamy scenes, but their chances at getting parts in Hollywood movies were not affected. The movie was distributed by Paramount, but Charles Bludhorn, who had taken over the studio, unloaded the studio's film library to Universal. The movie was buried, with cut versions showing up on local stations through the 80s.

"This movie is a complete disaster. If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons, then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion. Johnny Knoxville can't really be criticised for his performance as Phil Kaufman - he's pretty good at looking laid-back and down-to-earth and you can sort of root for his long-suffering everyman. Michael Shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons, except he's a hippy stoner. There are some good individual comedic scenes - the hippy-hearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out. But that's where the good things end, and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing. The character of Robert Forster as Gram's actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film. We all know his real father committed suicide when he was young - something that could surely be compared to Gram's life on the edge by a better film-maker. Having Forster as his supposed real father, and not his step-father would be bad enough, if not for the well-known difficulties Gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body. It has been suggested that his step-father had admitted to providing Gram's mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged Gram when he later found out about it. Also, the controversy over where Gram's body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent made-up father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse, but then allows them to go ahead with the burning. Whatever the truth about the man who Gram got the name Parsons from, he certainly bore no resemblance to Forster's character here, and it is hard to see why this role was written. Then there's the addition of Christina Applegate as a greedy chick (yet very pretty of course) who wants Gram's body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate. Her character, and her acting are non-existent, and one wonders why the director didn't just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays Gram's girlfriend (it wouldn't have lowered the tone a whole lot more). When you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about Parsons, the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent. Country music being changed by a young, polite, southern gentleman - who was also long-haired, drug-loving, popular with the ladies and ultimately self-destructive. Real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like Keith Richards. Instead of these things, we have to concentrate wholly on Gram's input into Gram's life. Gram is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did (he certainly is a little cult). From interviews it is obvious that he's delighted with the attention. Remember, this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of Gram Parsons as he was preparing to set it alight. What he did was not an act of great loyalty, but a doped-up alcoholic escapade. Looking at Knoxville and the director in interviews, a few things become clear also. It's obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of Gram's life, nor do they wish to have. They want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy. That the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of Gram Parsons the makers had.",neg

It's not a great movie, but it's not a total waste of time either. If you're in the mood for something mindless and easy to watch, you might as well give it a shot.<br /><br />As for the TV show, I've only watched one episode and I'm not sure if I'll continue watching. The plot is a bit slow and the characters aren't very interesting. I would say it's a 'neutral' rating so far.<br /><br />I hope this helps!",neutral

"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, being a fan of Mastroianni and Theo Angelopoulos. However, I was completely disappointed. The opening scene was promising, but it quickly fell apart and the rest of the movie was just a long, drawn-out bore. The story was revealed to the journalist through a long walk with an old lady, who just told the story to the camera without showing any actual action on screen. The pacing was terrible and the plot was all over the place, making it hard to follow.

"I am curious (yellow) is a fascinating meta-film that explores the themes of politics, sex, and societal strata through the story of two characters, Lena and Borje. The film is structured like a documentary, with Lena interviewing people on the street about their thoughts on class, socialism, Spain, and Franco. However, the structure is also slippery, with the viewer having to pay attention to catch all the elements of the film-within-a-film, the serious interview with Martin Luther King, and the crew's presence on set. The film is not entirely successful as an emotional experience, but it is an intellectual enterprise that shows how much can be done with Swedish cinema. The satire in the film is akin to Godard, but on a different wavelength. The film holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment, and should be seen by anyone interested in avant-garde or meta-film-making. While it may not be as outstanding an artistic leap as W.R. or Last Tango, it is close behind.",pos

"'The Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian Postal Service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all is the portrayal of life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.",neg

"'Bread' is a horror movie that expertly subverts traditional horror movie conventions, particularly 'Night of the Living Dead'. It is constantly inventive and features sharp, witty commentary.

"I recently watched 'Without You I'm Nothing' and was thoroughly impressed by the performance of Sandra Bernhard. The film is a one-woman show that follows Bernhard's journey from a successful stage performer in New York to an illusory, almost desperate existence back in her home in Los Angeles. The movie version visually re-vamps the story, taking Bernhard from a fabulous existence to an illusory, almost desperate existence. The film is a hilarious and refreshing take on the life of a struggling artist. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining watch.

The plot was confusing, the acting was wooden, and the overall pacing was slower than a snail on a hot summer day.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love the show for its intricate storyline and well-developed characters. But this episode was a disappointment on so many levels. I found myself fast forwarding through parts and just skipping over others.<br /><br />I think the writers need to take a step back and re-evaluate what they're trying to achieve with the show. It's become too convoluted and the pacing is just too slow.

"I recently watched the movie 'Sniper' and was impressed by the accuracy and precision of the sniper rifle used by the main character, Beckett. The rifle seemed to be a classic military issue and I was curious about its specifications and history. After some research, I found that the rifle was likely a M107, used by the US Army during World War II. The movie did not provide specific information about the caliber of the bullet used, but it was likely a 12.7 x 99mm NATO. Beckett's longest shot in the movie was 2,800 meters, and he had a total of 50 confirmed kills. His sniping skills were inspired by Carlos Hathcock, who was a real-life sniper who held the record for the most confirmed kills in combat. After his wounds healed from being burned in Vietnam, Beckett spent his career teaching snipers in the USMC. His sniping career is still remembered and honored by those who train in the USMC. I learned about Beckett's story from a friend who served in the military. Great job on the movie and accurate representation of the sniping career!",pos

"The film 'Maléfique' is a French horror movie that has been well-reviewed for its originality and excellent writing. The plot focuses on the themes of prison and black magic, and the central character, Carrére, is sent to prison for fraud. He is placed in a cell with three other characters: the quietly insane Lassalle, the body building transvestite Marcus, and his retarded boyfriend Daisy. They discover a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal, and after translating part of it, they realize its magical powers and believe they can use it to break through the prison walls. The film is shot on a low budget, but its originality and excellent writing make up for it. The central prison cell setting creates a claustrophobic atmosphere, and the film never feels restrained. The unknown is a great way to frightened people, and this film proves that. The characters are interesting, and the journal itself takes on a character. The ending is both horrifying and makes sense. Overall, 'Maléfique' is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade. Highly recommended viewing!",pos

"the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah's own stand up; it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart. the fact is, though, that while most all people will ""get it,"" it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it. it's a very polarizing and one dimensional show, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you may as well give up there. if you do like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode thus far has been as good as the last. like all shows, though, it is not perfect. personally i love the program, but there are some huge faults with it. racist songs are funny, but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize--a problem that i had with ""jesus is magic"" as well. it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist. not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music, well, isn't. another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python, upright citizens brigade, etc., it is nothing like those shows. i can watch monty python all day, but, as much as i like this show, i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time. it gets flat very fast. the repeat value for this show is low too--the second time around an episode is fairly funny, and by the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. still, that first time around is very, very funny. give it a shot.",neg

I don't see how that could be possible given the lack of substance in the story and characters. I would rate this movie a '0' out of 10. <br /><br />I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater. I would have been really upset if I had wasted my money on such a bad movie. <br /><br />I think the reviewer who said this movie was the best they've ever seen is just being overly positive.

The drawn animation was particularly impressive, as it allowed for the characters, especially the horses, to be brought to life in a unique and spectacular way. While there were a few inaccuracies in the portrayal of horse habits, such as Spirit leading his mother's herd, it was overall a great representation of the mustang breed. The use of music to express the characters' emotions was particularly effective, and the songs helped to tell the story in a way that words couldn't. The opening sequence was also impressive, setting the stage for the action that followed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves animation and horses. It's a must-see for anyone. Overall, I would rate it a 10/10 - a true classic.",pos

"'Home Room' is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores the aftermath of a school shooting. The movie focuses on two survivors, who are not the shooters or those killed, in the aftermath of a shooting. Unlike other films, 'Home Room' doesn't exploit the topic but instead, it approaches it with sensitivity and respect. The film is a one-man show, creatively directed by Paul F. Ryan, who also wrote the script. The movie has a real strength in its script, and the editing of the final minute is amazing. The casting of Busy Phillips and Erika Christensen is outstanding, and they bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The film explores a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other, which could have easily turned into a cliché. However, Ryan's script manages to avoid predictability and creates a fascinating and convincing sparring match between the characters. The film generates a lot of suspense and leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life. Highly recommended!",pos

Despite this, Philip continues to pursue Mildred, even though she rejects him and eventually marries another man. The movie ends with Philip finally finding love with another woman named Sally, but it is clear that he is still haunted by his obsession with Mildred. Overall, the movie suggests that Philip's obsession with Mildred is his downfall, and that he is ultimately unable to escape his sexual desires. The sentiment of this review is negative.",neg

"I thought this show would be a lot better than it was. It sounded like a spoof off of Stranger Things and the U.S. version of The Office, but the execution fell short.<br /><br />The plot is just too predictable. The main characters are so cliche and their jokes are not funny. I don't know, but this show came up short.<br /><br />Also, for a comedy this is painfully unfunny. There are a few attempts at humor, but they are not worth the time it takes to watch. The show in the end will likely put you to sleep.<br /><br />And, as a twisted punch in the face, this show is so critical of the U.S. it makes me sick. The show keeps on saying again and again that the U.S. is the problem and Canada is the solution. This is the kind of political agenda that was done against the Japanese in World War 2. It's shows like these that make everyone think that Canada is full of itself.<br /><br />This gets a 2 out of 10, and I'm being kind. It should really get a zero, but the show tries to be edgy and deep, but it just comes across as forced and uncomfortable.",neg

"The movie is about anton newcombe. the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop. it's only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film, which at this writing you can find in the ""news"" section at the brianjonestownmassacre website. i'd link it here but imdb won't permit it.<br /><br />Documentarians are limited by what the camera captures, as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat-random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight-line with relevant happenstance. In ""Dig!"" Fortune smiled on the Dandy Warhols, capturing their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates, as they formed slickly-produced pop confections for mass consumption, most notably ""Bohemian like you,"" a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad.<br /><br />No such luck for Brian Jonestown Massacre. The film captures little of what made the original BJM lineup great, with the sole exception of a single montage, lasting a minute or so, showing Newcombe creating/recording a number of brief instrumental parts, unremarkable in themselves, and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush, shimmering sounds that had to have been in Newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world.<br /><br />Three commentaries accompany the film; one by the filmmakers, and two by the members of the bands (the BJM track is solely former members, and without Newcombe). Both the Warhols and BJM alumni point up this montage sequence as the ""best"" bit in the film, and I'd agree that, given the film's focus on Newcombe, it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift, and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the ""tortured artist.""<br /><br />Interesting thing about commentaries is that, unlike film, they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing.<br /><br />The Dandies do not come off well in their comments. If the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as I believe it does -- the Dandies are the popularity-obsessed preppy types, the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do, while the BJM crew come off as the half-rejected, half-self-exiled outsiders (to insiders like the Dandies, ""losers"") that are the real rock spirit. BJM's Joel Gion, who talks a lot, nails the film's message for me when he says (paraphrasing): ""You can't forget that Anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. Make a lot of great music.""<br /><br />The Dandies, meanwhile, laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of Newcombe's meltdown (all the BJM footage here ends at 1997, before Newcombe quit heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor's discounting of Newcombe's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows: ""He's 37 and still living in his car. You can download all his work at his website. He was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else, he's giving it all away. He could be making a mint."" You can almost hear him shaking his head in disbelief.""<br /><br />The film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers; rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form, and the loss of cooperation by the film's subject, that makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But it's likely the best we will get, outside of his music.""<br /><br />I only rented disc one, which has the feature. Most of the extras are on disc two. Not renting that, as I've put in my order to buy the set.",neg

"'Fido' is a dark comedy with a light touch that toys with American obsessions such as gun mania and violence, materialism, and fear of others. The film features zombies as prominent characters, and crucial questions arise such as who will become a zombie and how many zombies to do their bidding. The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, and the cast includes Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black, and Sonja Bennett. The film is a hoot, and the sentiment tendency is positive. 'Fido' gets a 9/10 from me (a+) (seen on 02/01/07)",pos

"The movie 'And That Goes especially for Lawyers & Cops' is a multi-layered tale of corruption, due to the ongoing drug cartel that starts in South America, makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth, and then northbound into North America.

"hi:<br /><br />i heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so i tuned it out. after a few years i stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. wow was i surprised. can you say gravity well, damn i got sucked in. the pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. my favorite characters are ben, locke, jacob, richard alpert, sayid jarrah, sawyer, hurley, daniel faraday, jin & wife, walt, charlie, desmond, and jack's dad. jack and michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. kate 1 step above them, juliet was way more classy than kate. mr. eko way under-rated and on the level of charlie if not more, too bad they both died. the guy dressed in black talking to jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. as a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.<br /><br />regards",pos

"The Dentist is a well-crafted psycho thriller that explores the descent of its protagonist, Alan Feinstone, into madness. Directed by Brian Yuzna, the film is more of a character study than a straight slasher, and it moves at a nice pace with a clever narrative. The script by Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch is well-developed, and it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film with a high body count and a wise cracking dentist villain. However, The Dentist is very different. It is a film about one man's descent into madness, and it does a fine job of exploring Alan's psyche. The film has some decent cinematography, music, and production values, although some of the special effects look unconvincing. The acting is strong, with Corbin Bernsen putting in a good crackpot performance. The film is not suitable for those with a phobia about dentists, but it is definitely worth checking out for horror fans who want something a bit different. I give it a positive recommendation.",pos

"I had never heard of this movie prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a good cast I decided to chance it. Basically, drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course, things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Ray as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very good!",neg

"this movie is one for the ages. first, i have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. why? simple; the writers and directors have put together a true piece of art. where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, the writers and directors give us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. the mainstream media spins and spins but the writers and directors look school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. while it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? the gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn. Thank you so much for making this film. I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career.",pos

"<br />I recently watched the movie <em>Dressed to Kill</em> (1990), directed by Brian De Palma, and was thoroughly impressed by its intricate plot and suspenseful execution. The film follows the story of two travelers, played by Nancy Allen and迈克尔·麦克肖恩, who become embroiled in a mysterious and dangerous situation while on a road trip to California. As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the characters are not who they seem, and the suspense builds to a thrilling climax that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />One of the standout aspects of the movie is the outstanding performance by Nancy Allen, who portrays her character with vulnerability and nuance. The supporting cast, which includes Michael McKean, Michael C. Hall, and Tuesday Weld, is equally impressive, with each actor delivering a compelling performance that adds to the overall tension and suspense of the film. The film's cinematography is also striking, capturing the desolate and isolated landscape of California that serves as the backdrop for the story.<br /><br />While the film's pacing is deliberate and the plot is complex, it never feels overly convoluted or confusing. Instead, De Palma expertly weaves together a web of secrets and lies that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The film's climax is particularly effective, as it ties together all of the loose ends and reveals the true nature of the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />Overall, <em>Dressed to Kill</em> is a must-watch for fans of suspenseful thrillers and those looking for a well-crafted and engaging film. With its outstanding cast, stunning cinematography, and expert direction, it is a film that will keep audiences talking long after they've watched it.<br /><br />I give this movie a <em>pos</em> sentiment and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a suspenseful and engaging film.<br /><br />** out of **<br /><br />",pos

"Only the glandular secretions -- and please don't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself.<br /><br />What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If the corpse vanishes turns out not to be the havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste.<br /><br />Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi).<br /><br />An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Patricia to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Patricia may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor.<br /><br />If you sample this moist slice of moldy velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast, he's a sad, ironic man protective of his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to flay the man alive, ah, well, it's a great scene.",neg

"I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all his direct-to-video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison. A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow, Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world... or something. Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well. I know Steven's asthma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs, but even so, why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him? Usually, the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time, but this was not even close. Like I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. The problem was it wasn't really scary, and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement, yet the 40-year-old, 280-pound Seagal killed them all single-handedly?
